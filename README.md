Stock assessment methods in the face of anomalous recruitment events

A Monte Carlo simulation with [ss3sim](www.github.com/ss3sim/ss3sim) to assess the effects of anomalous recruitment events on the performance of age-structured stock assessment models. Where the results will be presented at the [Center for the Advancement of Population Assessment Methodology](http://www.capamresearch.org) workshop on [recruitment](http://www.capamresearch.org/workshops), October 30th-November 3rd, 2017, and submitted to the special issue of Fisheries Research.
