# Introduction
 Outline
 Driving Question: How do anomalous recruitment events affect the performance of age-structured stock assessment models?
 
  P1
  
  What was observed in the 2017 stock assessment cycle with POP?
  
  What is an anomalous recruitment event?
  
  Are there other examples of such events?
  
  Why do we think these events happen?
  
  What are some examples in PNW?
  
  P2
  
  How does fisheries management work in PNW/PFMC Groundfish?
  
  What are age-structured stock assessment models?
  
  What are recruitment deviations?
  
  How are recruitment deviations used in age-structured stock assessment models?
  
  What are the potential implications for management?
  
  P3
  
  What is a Monte Carlo simulation?
  
  How has this tool been used previously?
  
  What is ss3sim?
  
  P4
  
  What is the driving question of our paper?
  
  How do we plan on addressing the question?
  
  Why are PFMC rockfishes a good case study group?
